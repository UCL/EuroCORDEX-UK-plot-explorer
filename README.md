# UKCORDEX Plot Explorer
This analysis and visualisation tool is a React application designed to allow rapid exploration of the key structures of the model outputs in the UKCP18 projections and the EuroCORDEX ensembles, along with their driving models, for a large number of weather variables and derived indices of climate over the UK.

Users can select climate indices, seasons and time periods of interest and can compare the various model outputs, produce maps and boxplots of historical biases and projected changes in these indices, and quantify the dominant sources of variation and uncertainty within the projections. This enables users both to evaluate the outputs, and to choose appropriate subsets of model runs for use in their own applications. A suggested order of analyses is given in [the usage guide](https://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/UKCORDEX-plot-explorer-dev/#/how-to-use).

The plots and underlying data are downloadable directly from the plot explorer.

## Developer's guide

The code in this repository has been moved to [the Plot Explorer's development repository](https://github.com/UCL/UKCORDEX-plot-explorer-dev).
That repository contains details on the workflow for adding new features and bug fixes, as well as instructions on how to run, test and deploy the codebase.
